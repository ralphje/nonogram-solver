nonogram-solver
===============

Simple script that solves nonograms. It has no great interface, just pass in the nonogram in two lists of lists into
`Puzzle()` and either call `solve()` or `solve_step()` to solve the nonogram entirely or on a step-by-step basis
respectively.

This script was made to solve a nonogram featured in the Break-In introduction newsletter of the University of Twente
Kick-In 2014 introduction week ([edition 2 of Thursday 21 August 2014](http://www.scribd.com/doc/237386528/Break-In-2014-Editie-2)). Feel free to adjust, add nice interfaces, add a
brute-force solver, or whatever you want to do with it. Pull requests are welcome.
